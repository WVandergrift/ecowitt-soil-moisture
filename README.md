# Ecowitt Soil Moisture Sensors

This plugin works with Ecowitt gateways to expose soil moisture sensors. It's been tested with the below gateways and sensors.

Gateways:
  - Ecowitt GW1100

Sensors:
  - WH51
  - GW1106 (Probably the same as WH51 just packaged with a GW1100)

For now, this plugin only supports exposing soil moisture sensors, if there's demand, I can look into expanding it to include other device types.

## Usage
After adding the plugin, you'll need to enter your Ecowitt gateway's hostname or IP address as a URL (ex: http://192.168.0.137)

I've been using the plugin to add soil moisture sensors to Homekit to monitor plants in our landscaping:
